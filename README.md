# daysPad

This is the Qt Widgets application which allows user to chose a date using a calendar and to write a text note about that day.
Application stores data in file.
User is allowed to write multiline notes. Data in file is stored in almost text form, so it is possible to change arbitrary records. But it is not desirable because there mustn't be any space ar newline characters in the middle of the record.
